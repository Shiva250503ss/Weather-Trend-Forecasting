# Weather Forecasting Models Comparison 🌤️

This repository documents a comprehensive comparison of various weather forecasting models, utilizing a rich dataset of global weather readings. The project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of both statistical and machine learning models in accurately predicting weather conditions.

## 📊 Project Insights

The analysis begins with thorough data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's characteristics. It includes histograms to visualize distributions of temperature, humidity, and wind speed, helping identify patterns or anomalies in weather conditions.

### 📈 Model Evaluation
The project extensively compares the performance of the ARIMA and Prophet models, alongside an ensemble approach that averages the predictions of both models. This comparative study is detailed through the calculation of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metrics, which help in understanding the precision of each model.

### 🔍 Unique Analyses
Several unique analyses are conducted to delve deeper into the data:
- **🌡️ Temperature Distribution by Country**: Utilizes boxplots to examine temperature variability across countries, illustrating how geographic location influences climate behavior.
- **🌬️ Air Quality vs. Climate Parameters**: A correlation matrix analysis explores the relationships between air quality indices and climate parameters, highlighting interactions such as the moderate correlations between air quality and humidity.
- **🔑 Feature Importance in Weather Prediction**: Using a Random Forest Regressor, the project identifies key features that significantly affect temperature predictions, like atmospheric pressure and latitude.
- **🗺️ Spatial and Geographical Patterns**: Through spatial mapping and aggregation of data by continent, the analyses reveal how temperature distributions vary globally and regionally.

## 📚 Conclusion
The project's findings emphasize the utility of machine learning models in enhancing weather forecasting accuracy and suggest further avenues for research, including the integration of more diverse data sources and hybrid models.

This repository serves as a resource for those interested in the statistical and machine learning aspects of climate analysis and weather prediction, offering both raw data and detailed analyses for public use and further development.
